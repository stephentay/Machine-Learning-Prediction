# Machine Learning Prediction Project
This Machine Learning Prediction project is part of Johns Hopkins University's course assignment requirement.

There are three other files in this repo:

- **Assignment Report.Rmd** which provides the R markdown code for the analysis.
- **index.html**. Please note that Github could only display this in its raw HTML form. The rendered HTML can be viewed in the gh-pages branch or at this link: https://stephentay.github.io/Machine-Learning-Prediction/ 
- **corrplot.png** shows the plot of the correlations between the features.


Please refer to index.html or https://stephentay.github.io/Machine-Learning-Prediction/ for the details of this project.
